                        BBIPPL believes Design Automation and reducing human interaction is the key to add value to our services. We always emphasize to improve productivity and perform all repetitive and time consuming tasks by implementing macros, tools, utilities and batch jobs, thanks to Application Programming Interfaces (API) of respective software packages and open source libraries. These are implemented as per our customer requirements and BBIPPL shall follow SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) phases and keeping future customer’s future roadmap in mind. The following are typical Design Automation areas but not limited to,
                        •	Automating the creation of complex features 
                        •	Automate to create Design Reports, Bill of Materials (BOM), Drawings, and Manufacturing Instructions / Notes etc.
                        •	Improving product quality by performing design rule verification based on inputs from an external Knowledge Based System or Rule Engine.
