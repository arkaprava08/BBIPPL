                    <div id="panel1" class="content">
                        Smart grid refers to the transformation of the electric power system into an “energy Internet” allowing utilities and customers to share information in real time, often automatically, so that both sides can more effectively manage electricity use. A smart grid promises to make the outdated power system more reliable, preventing losses and thefts, which cost the nation a lot. Smart grid also could dramatically reduce energy use and emissions. If fully deployed—and accompanied by policy support for decentralized power, renewable power—smart grid could reduce energy use and emissions.
                        Clearly, in addition to reliability, energy efficiency and other societal benefits, the development of a smart grid will create economic opportunities. Many Utilities are moving quickly to provide a widening array of new devices, software, controls, communications, and services.
                        Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is architecture for automated, two-way communication between a smart utility meter with an IP address and a utility company. The goal of an AMI is to provide utility companies with real-time data about power consumption and allow customers to make informed choices about energy usage based on the price at the time of use.

                        AMI is seen as an important part of any smart grid initiative.

                        At the heart of a consumer AMI system is the Smart Meter. Typically a smart meter is required to support various features like Multi-tariff, Automatic Billing, Remote Connect/ Disconnect and Remote Firmware upgrade. To support these features, it is desired that the meters support a wide variety of communication channel options like Zigbee, PLC or GPRS and standard communication protocols like DLMS and ANSI. But, today most of the existing installations have only legacy meters that might support only serial communication channels and/or proprietary protocols.
                        The communication capability of such legacy meters can be enhanced by means of smart Meter Interface Cards/Meter Interface Units. The MIC/ MIU imparts standard based communication capability to these meters which otherwise might support only legacy communication protocols. Data concentrator is an intelligent embedded device which can be installed any where in the LV network to communicate with meter periodically and on demand. The data concentrator will internally store the data read from meters and will be served to central system either by PULL or by PUSH mode

                        We also provide Prepaid Electronic Energy Meter for measuring the amount of energy supplied . Our prepaid energy meters adopt the latest technology to measure the active energy.

                        Brick & Byte has developed Data Concentrator Units intended for data acquisition, transmission and storage of metering data from consumer meters to data center, on request or by push mechanism.
                        The DCU is suited for installation in medium voltage (MV) / low voltage (LV) transformer stations as well as at the customer premises.
                        It has numerous plug-in options for connecting meters at the downstream end (LV Power-line carrier (PLC) modem / Low power Radio modem / Serial RS232/485 port). Cellular modem (GPRS/CDMA/PSTN/WIMAX) and Wide Area Network (via Ethernet/ VSAT) are the options available for upstream communication to central system.

                        The data concentrator can read meters from pre-loaded and programmable schedules or from spontaneous tasks, initiated by central system. It can record daily billing data, hourly/daily profile values and events and store locally for periodic / ad-hoc transmission to the central system. The metering DCU can poll data cyclically on a pre-programmed interval or on ad-hoc basis for on-demand/demand scan. This is Smart-Grid ready and supports bidirectional communication for AMI and Demand Response applications, as well as supporting remote configuration and upgrade.
                        Data concentrator unit is a micro controller based device which has dual communication capabilities Viz. GPRS and LPR. DCU is designed to collect the data from Meter Interface Unit over Low Power Radio and transfer the data further to the central server using GPRS. It has been within built power supply which can withstand surges up to 6 KV and also has rechargeable Li-ion battery.

                        Maximum Demand Controller is applicable for medium and large scale industries to reduce demand peaks without affecting their operation. Maximum demand charges are collected based on the highest recorded demand peak in the month. By temporarily reducing the loads during the periods of high demand the maximum demand charges can be reduced.

                        Two measure benefits when maximum demand is limited to a predetermined level.
                        •	Released electrical system capacity.
                        •	Reduced operating cost.
                        Maximum demand controller is a device designed to meet the need of load management for industries. Alarm I sounded when demand approaches a present value. If corrective action is not taken, the controller switches OFF non essential load in a sequence. The plant equipments selected for load management are stopped and restarted. Demand control is achieved by using suitable contactors and electrical hooters.
                        Features:
                        •	Better utilization of available power
